            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
                Born on 19 May 1999 in Bern, I pursued a versatile and technically oriented education. After my apprenticeship as a design engineer at 
                GF Machining Solutions and the completion of my technical vocational baccalaureate, I am now studying Data Science at the FHNW in Brugg. 
                Alongside my studies, I teach at Codecamp, where I teach children between the ages of 6 and 12 how to programme.

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                Football is one of my great passions. I have been playing for FC Klus Balsthal for over a decade and also coach the club's EA juniors.
                Apart from football, I love being active in the gym and cooking new meals for my family and myself. I enjoy the fresh air on walks and 
                I'm always ready to learn new things and take on challenges. As a passionate Manchester United and Croatia fan, I regularly follow football
                matches. I have recently taken up golf, although I often don't have the time.

            <h3>Family</h3>
            <p>
                My family is very important to me. I have two siblings, Tin (35) and Eli (30), as well as my parents Augustin and Silvana. We often do
                activities together, such as going out to eat and exploring Japanese culture and cuisine with my brother or watching horror films and playing
                exit games with my sister. I love cooking with my mum and enjoy tea with her and my brother every day. My father and I share a passion for
                football and enjoy activities together such as fishing and skiing.

            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>

                My professional experience includes various roles and projects. During my training as a design engineer, I worked on numerous fixtures,
                which helped me to excel and face daily challenges. As a teacher at Codecamp, I enjoy passing on my knowledge and enthusiasm for technology
                to the next generation. I also help vocational high school students in maths.

        <h3>Reflection on Skills Audit</h3>
        <p class="blog-date">Posted on 17.01.2024</p>
        <p>
            Participating in the Careersmart Skills Audit was a truly eye-opening experience. It not only highlighted my strengths in areas like 
            problem-solving and teamwork but also brought to light key skills I need to develop, specifically in commercial awareness and communication. 
            This realization is particularly vital for my career in data science, where understanding business nuances and effective communication play 
            a significant role. I see this as a call to action to engage more deeply with these areas, enhancing my skill set. This journey of self-improvement 
            is exciting and necessary, as it aligns with my professional goals and the dynamic nature of the tech industry. The audit has provided a clear path 
            for my continuous learning and personal development, emphasizing the need to adapt and grow in a constantly evolving field.

        <h3>My Dream Data Science Internship at Statistisches Amt des Kantons Zürich</h3>
        <p class="blog-date">Posted on 17.01.2024</p>
        <p>
            I'm studying Data Science at FHNW in Brugg and am in my third semester. Finding a place where I can use what I've learned in real life is important to me. 
            The internship at Statistisches Amt des Kantons Zürich is just what I'm looking for. This job is about using data to help the public, and it includes 
            working on web projects. This is exactly the kind of work I want to do. Being part of a team that uses data to make things better and clearer for everyone 
            is a great way to start my career.<br><br>
            In school, I've learned a lot about Data Science. I've taken classes on data analysis, programming, and how to visualize data. I'm really good at using R 
            for programming. I used to work in a different field, so I'm good at getting used to new things. I think these skills make me a good match for the job. 
            The job needs someone who knows about data, programming in R, and machine learning, and I've got these skills.<br><br>
            I can't wait to use my skills in analysis and programming at Statistisches Amt. I learn fast and I'm good at facing new challenges. I can help with 
            different tasks, like analyzing data and making the website better. I also want to help teach people about data and get them involved. I'm excited to 
            be part of a team that makes data easy to understand and use for everyone.
