            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
                Born on 19 May 1999 in Bern, I pursued a versatile and technically oriented education. After my apprenticeship as a design engineer at 
                GF Machining Solutions and the completion of my technical vocational baccalaureate, I am now studying Data Science at the FHNW in Brugg. 
                Alongside my studies, I teach at Codecamp, where I teach children between the ages of 6 and 12 how to programme.

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                Football is one of my great passions. I have been playing for FC Klus Balsthal for over a decade and also coach the club's EA juniors.
                Apart from football, I love being active in the gym and cooking new meals for my family and myself. I enjoy the fresh air on walks and 
                I'm always ready to learn new things and take on challenges. As a passionate Manchester United and Croatia fan, I regularly follow football
                matches. I have recently taken up golf, although I often don't have the time.

            <h3>Family</h3>
            <p>
                My family is very important to me. I have two siblings, Tin (35) and Eli (30), as well as my parents Augustin and Silvana. We often do
                activities together, such as going out to eat and exploring Japanese culture and cuisine with my brother or watching horror films and playing
                exit games with my sister. I love cooking with my mum and enjoy tea with her and my brother every day. My father and I share a passion for
                football and enjoy activities together such as fishing and skiing.

            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>
                My professional experience includes various roles and projects. During my training as a design engineer, I worked on numerous fixtures,
                which helped me to excel and face daily challenges. As a teacher at Codecamp, I enjoy passing on my knowledge and enthusiasm for technology
                to the next generation. I also help vocational high school students in maths.

            <h3>Web Scraping IMDB Top 1000 Movies</h3>
            <p>For my first project, I delved into the realm of data collection through web scraping. I developed a web scraper in Python, leveraging 
                the capabilities of Selenium and Fake UserAgent libraries. This tool is intricately designed to extract and parse data from IMDB's 
                top 1000 rated movies. It captures an array of movie details, including ranks, titles, release years, ratings, durations, genres, 
                directors, and star casts.

            <h3>Weather Monitor for Watersports Enthusiasts</h3>
            <p>The Weather Monitor project is an innovative solution designed to cater to the needs of watersports enthusiasts. This sophisticated 
                system aggregates real-time weather data from various weather stations, offering a user-friendly dashboard for easy visualization. 
                The primary aim is to assist watersports aficionados in making informed decisions about when to safely engage in their activities on the water.

            <h3>Rockfall Risk Evaluation</h3>
            <p>As part of a team project during my studies at the FHNW for BSc in Data Science, we embarked on a critical assessment of the risk 
                of fatalities on the Cantonal Road B28 due to rockfall. We scrutinized data collected from a road in Schiers, GR, which runs dangerously 
                close to a steep cliff prone to frequent rockfall. The existing safety nets, designed to catch falling rocks, were aged and no longer met 
                safety standards, posing a potential failure within the next year that could lead to severe accidents or even fatalities.
