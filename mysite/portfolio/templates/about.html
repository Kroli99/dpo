            <img src="{% static 'Aareschlucht.JPG' %}" alt="">
            <p>
                Born on 19 May 1999 in Bern, I pursued a versatile and technically oriented education. After my apprenticeship as a design engineer at 
                GF Machining Solutions and the completion of my technical vocational baccalaureate, I am now studying Data Science at the FHNW in Brugg. 
                Alongside my studies, I teach at Codecamp, where I teach children between the ages of 6 and 12 how to programme.

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <img src="{% static 'FC1.JPG' %}" alt="">
            <p>
                Football is one of my great passions. I have been playing for FC Klus Balsthal for over a decade and also coach the club's EA juniors.
                Apart from football, I love being active in the gym and cooking new meals for my family and myself. I enjoy the fresh air on walks and 
                I'm always ready to learn new things and take on challenges. As a passionate Manchester United and Croatia fan, I regularly follow football
                matches. I have recently taken up golf, although I often don't have the time.

            <img src="{% static 'Manchester1.JPG' %}" alt="">
            <p>
                My family is very important to me. I have two siblings, Tin (35) and Eli (30), as well as my parents Augustin and Silvana. We often do
                activities together, such as going out to eat and exploring Japanese culture and cuisine with my brother or watching horror films and playing
                exit games with my sister. I love cooking with my mum and enjoy tea with her and my brother every day. My father and I share a passion for
                football and enjoy activities together such as fishing and skiing.

            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
            <img src="{% static 'Codecamp.jpeg' %}" alt="">
            <p>
                My professional experience includes various roles and projects. During my training as a design engineer, I worked on numerous fixtures,
                which helped me to excel and face daily challenges. As a teacher at Codecamp, I enjoy passing on my knowledge and enthusiasm for technology
                to the next generation. I also help vocational high school students in maths.
